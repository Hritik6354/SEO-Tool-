# SEO-Tool-
My Internship Project

The SEO Tool works by allowing users to create and manage multiple SEO analysis projects through a secure login system. Once a project is created by entering a website URL, the tool uses Python libraries like Requests and BeautifulSoup to fetch and parse the website's HTML content. It then analyzes key SEO elements such as H1 tags, meta titles and descriptions, internal and external links, broken links, and keyword density. The results are saved in a database, linked to the specific user and project, and displayed in a structured dashboard. Users can also view a history of past crawls to monitor progress and improvements over time.
